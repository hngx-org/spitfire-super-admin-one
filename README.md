## Database Schema

The Spitfire Superadmin API utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data efficiently. This schema defines the structure and relationships of the tables used to store information related to shops, products, vendors, and more.
Tables: Shop table
        Product table
        Vendor table

## Authentication

Every endpoint in this API is meant to be used by the super admin user. To access any of the endpoints, you will need an authentication token.

## Error Handling


> Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format with their error code

```json
{
  "error": "error name",
  "message": "error description"
}
```

<br>

The API will return 5 error types, with diffreent descriptions when requests fail;

- 400: Request unprocessable
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: resource not found
- 422: Bad Request
- 429: Too Many Requests(rate limiting)
- 500: Internal server error

<br>

**Note:** ensure you are connected to the internet before running tests and are in `spitfire-events` directory

```bash
# install test suite and HTTP requests library
$ pip install requests pytest

cd super_admin_1
$ pytest tests\* -v
```
